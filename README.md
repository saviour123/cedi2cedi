# cedi2cedi
------------------------------------------------------
To conclude my exploit on the tornado framework I built something in honour of the lady I love. Curious to know her?
I call this app cedi2cedi, don't laugh! I does conversion from New Ghana Cedis to Old Ghana and vice-versa.
I can be budle simpler with static HTML or PHP. 
Give me some stars when you like the project.
